By implementing a personalisable dictionary through a multi-threaded server, multiple clients are able to concurrently:
1. Query the meaning(s) of a word
2. Add a new word
3. Remove an existing word.

The system includes both the server and client implementations, and feature explicit use of Java Threads and Sockets for concurrent processing and remote communication. The custom dictionary data is read in from a local file.
