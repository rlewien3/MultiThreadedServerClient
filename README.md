By implementing a personalisable dictionary through a multi-threaded server, multiple clients are able to concurrently:
1. Query the meaning(s) of a word
2. Add a new word
3. Remove an existing word.

The system includes both the server and client implementations, and feature explicit use of Java Sockets and Threads for communication and concurrent processing.
